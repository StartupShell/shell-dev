Final decisions will be made <strong>Friday, September 27</strong>, and emails will roll out that night.
	<p>All undergraduate and graduate students are eligible to apply regardless of major, college, or graduation year. Every applicant will be offered an interview, which will be conducted in groups. We will send out emails about signing up for interview slots. Applications will also be accepted on a more selective rolling basis afterwards. There is no limit to the number of times you may apply. Should you not be accepted for membership, there are many opportunities to stay engaged, including special programs for applicants only.</p>
	<p>If you apply as a group or startup team, your team will only be admitted in full so as to not fragment team leadership. Each member must still fill out applications individually, but please mention your team in the projects question.</p>
